## What apps/programs is this Library intended for?

This library should be used by Swift apps/programs or libraries that needs the code provvided here.

This code should work across multiple platforms compatible with Swift and that provvides the necessary function calls using the Foundation module.

## About the project:

This code was created as part of my [TINU project](https://github.com/ITzTravelInTime/TINU) and it has been separated and made into it's own library to make the main project's source less complex and more focused on it's aim. 

Also having this as it's own library allows for code to be updated separately and so various versions of the main TINU app will be able to be compiled all with the latest version of this library.
